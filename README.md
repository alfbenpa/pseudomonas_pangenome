# pseudomonas_pangenome
pangenome and domain annotation of pseudomonas aeruginosa (Mosquera-Rendon et al., BMC Genomics 2016;17:45)

The information stored in this repository is freely available!

When you decompress the pseudomonas_pangenome.tar.gz file you will find two major folders named:

  /pangenome  : containing the entire set of single fasta sequences characterized to be the P. aeruginosa pangenome. They are                 called in numeric and consecutive manner (i.e. 1.fasta, 2.fasta,...)
  
  /SMART:       containing the automatic SAMRT/PFAM annotation of every single file contained in the /pangenome folder
  
Additionally, you will find a couple of files where the SMART/PFAM annotation information is compiled in just one single file:

  domain_analysis:      plain text information of pangenome SMART/PFAM annotation
  
  domain_analysis.ods:  similar to previous file but in libreoffice spreadsheet format
